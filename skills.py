computer = 'Computer : an electronic device that has the ability to receive data, modify it, process it and convert it to valuable information,' \
           'then store it in internal or external storage media. ðŸ—¿ \n Computers vary in their speed and specifications. \n' \
           'Computers operate with an operating system and without it computers are useless.'

hardware = 'Hardware : it is the set of physical parts of a computer system, that make up the computer.\n' \
           'Such as the screen, keyboard, data storage media (such as the hard disk), \n' \
           'and the system unit ðŸ—¿ (graphics card, sound card, memory , motherboard, and other chips etc.). \n' \
           'that is all physical things that can be touched. Conversely, software and data are not included in the description of computer hardware.'
software = 'software : it is a set of machine-readable instructions that direct a computer\'s processor to perform specific operations. ðŸ—¿ \n' \
           'a set of software and computer hardware make up a usable computer system.'

# processing devices
CPU = 'CPU : the processor is a small silicon chip that contains complex electronic circuits. ðŸ—¿ '
# the cpu consists of the following units..
arithmetic_logical_unit = 'arithmetic logical unit : it is where arithmetic and logical operations are processed.'
control_unit = 'control unit : it is considered the brain of the computer, it can issue commands to all computer departments and coordinate among them to perform the required functions between them. '

# storage devices
storage_devices = 'storage devices : it allows the user to store data before or after processing it to get it back later.'
hard_disk = 'hard disk : it is a magnetic-coated metal disc placed inside an airtight and sealed container. Information is stored in it permanently with the ability to delete or re-store it.'
floppy_disk = 'floppy disk : it consists of cylinders made of plastic material and coated with brown magnetic material and is considered a mobile store, but its storage capacity is limited.'
# optical disk
# magnetic tapes

# input devices
# mouse, keyboard, scanner, touch screen

# output devices
# screen = 'or monitor , computer screen is used to putput data ina  format known to users.'
# printer = 'there are many types of printers in large companies laser printers are used most often
# because they print very quickly and their output is of outstanding quality'
# painter = 'or plotter an output devices similar to a printer but it allows printing large photos.'
# headphones : speakers
# audio converter

# notes : 1) there are many types of computers in terms of method of operations size, and speed
# 2) the first computers were in the size of a large room and consumed energy similar
# to what a few hundreds pcs can consume today
# 3) ...

# application software is the software that enables u to perform a useful task on ur computer
# productivity software is  a software that help a human perform one or more business or personal enrichment tasks

# note : productivity software is designed to allow u to get things done and other application software is designed to either
# entertain u or to help u learn something

system_software = 'software that starts the computer and keep it running , performing basic system tasks such as' \
                  'running applications, managing files, and correcting errors'

# system software includes BIOS, the operating system and utility programs

# BIOS (basic input output system)
# note : the bios is stored on a read only chip on the motherboard, so it doesn't get accidentally changed or corrupted
# note : bios is the software that initializes and tests the system at start-up
BIOS = 'is the built in software on the motherboard that starts the computer'
the_booting_process = 'the bios performs a power on self test which ensures that all critical hardware devices are' \
                      'functioning properly (including CPU, Ram and motherboard\n' \
                      'if the hardware passes the test the BIOS looks for an OS on the available storage devices' \
                      'and then passes of control to the OS to complete the booting process'

# note : bios have a list of default settings it uses for managing memory and devices
# those settings can be overridden by user settings that u specify

# note : BIOS start the computer at a basic level but the OS does the bulk of work to keep it running at to
# help the user accomplis tasks

# the operating system performs these important functions
# 1) provides the user interface to help the user communicate commands and receive feedback
# 2) communicates with the hardware instructing it to take action to accomplish tasks
# 3) it runs applications and help humans interact with them
# 4) it controls and manages the file storage system ( manage files)

# operating systems examples
# windows, macOS, linux for  desktop and notebook PC's
# unix for main frames and servers
# android, IOS and Windows Phone for tablets and smartphones
# note : Microsoft Windows is the most popular OS

# note : the operating system on a tablet is designed to be compact , easy to operate, fast to respond
# note : the os on a tablet is compact because there is limited storage space on it
# note : the os on a tablet is easy to use because most people are not computer professionals


# note : some operating systems are designed to run on just one specific platform.
a_platform = 'a type of computer hardware that is compatible with certain operating systems.'

# note : intel platforms were originally based on CPUs made by intel
# note : the intel platform can run unix, windows, linux and newer versions of macOS
# note : the 32-bit intel platform is sometimes called x86 and the 64-bit platform is sometimes called x64.
# note : Windows 7 comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions

# user interface
# note : an OS can have either a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface
graphical_user_interface = 'it is a user interface based on a graphical environment, in which users interact with it ' \
                           'using a pointing device (mouse) or touch screen as the primary input device'
command_line_interface = 'a user interface based on typing text at a command prompt'
